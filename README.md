## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source communication standard introduced by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) in November 2024. MCP standardizes how artificial intelligence systems, especially large language models (LLMs), connect and interact with external tools, data sources, and systems. It acts like a "super high-speed network cable" that enables AI to seamlessly access files, execute functions, and handle contextual prompts from various external applications.

Think of MCP this way: AI is like a very smart but homebound bookworm, and MCP is its delivery service that brings data and enables the AI to get things done beyond just chatting.

MCP uses a client-server model: The AI-powered application acts as the *host* running an MCP *client*, while external integrations run as MCP *servers* exposing specific functions or data. This makes AI-tool integration uniform, scalable, and easy to manage.

## Why MCP Matters

MCP solves a major challenge in AI development: connecting AI systems with diverse and siloed data sources typically requiring custom integration code for each source. Before MCP, the complexity of integrations grew multiplicatively as tools and AI systems multiplied.

By providing a universal, open standard, MCP reduces integration complexity from an M×N problem (where every AI and data source pair requires custom code) to a simpler, composable system where AI models and data sources communicate through a shared protocol.

This standardization unlocks AI's true potential by enabling more relevant responses, real-time data access, meaningful actions like sending emails or querying databases, and smooth human-AI collaboration.

Adoption by major AI providers, developer tools, and enterprises signals MCP's role as a foundational protocol for the future of AI applications.

## Getting Started with MCP

Getting started with MCP involves understanding its core components and exploring available clients and servers:

* **MCP Clients:** These act as the AI's control panels, embedded in applications like [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) or enhanced IDEs like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), allowing AI apps to connect to MCP servers.
* **MCP Servers:** These provide the external capabilities—such as access to GitHub repositories, databases, browser automation, or messaging services—that AI can utilize through MCP.
* **Transport and Messaging:** MCP uses [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) over STDIO or HTTP+SSE for communication, ensuring a flexible, secure, and extensible connection.

To begin, try official MCP clients connecting to popular servers like [Slack MCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/slack) or [GitHub MCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github) to see AI tooling in action.

See the [official MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for detailed specs, example implementations, and SDKs.

To begin, try official MCP clients connecting to popular servers like Slack MCP or GitHub MCP to see AI tooling in action. For developers, building custom MCP servers involves implementing the MCP spec and exposing desired capabilities.
