## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source communication standard introduced by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) in November 2024. MCP standardizes how artificial intelligence systems, especially large language models (LLMs), connect and interact with external tools, data sources, and systems. It acts like a "super high-speed network cable" that enables AI to seamlessly access files, execute functions, and handle contextual prompts from various external applications.

Think of MCP this way: AI is like a very smart but homebound bookworm, and MCP is its delivery service that brings data and enables the AI to get things done beyond just chatting.

MCP uses a client-server model: The AI-powered application acts as the *host* running an MCP *client*, while external integrations run as MCP *servers* exposing specific functions or data. This makes AI-tool integration uniform, scalable, and easy to manage.

## Why MCP Matters

MCP solves a major challenge in AI development: connecting AI systems with diverse and siloed data sources typically requiring custom integration code for each source. Before MCP, the complexity of integrations grew multiplicatively as tools and AI systems multiplied.

By providing a universal, open standard, MCP reduces integration complexity from an M×N problem (where every AI and data source pair requires custom code) to a simpler, composable system where AI models and data sources communicate through a shared protocol.

This standardization unlocks AI's true potential by enabling more relevant responses, real-time data access, meaningful actions like sending emails or querying databases, and smooth human-AI collaboration.

Adoption by major AI providers, developer tools, and enterprises signals MCP's role as a foundational protocol for the future of AI applications.

## Getting Started with MCP

Getting started with MCP involves understanding its core components and exploring available clients and servers:

* **MCP Clients:** These act as the AI's control panels, embedded in applications like [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) or enhanced IDEs like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), allowing AI apps to connect to MCP servers.
* **MCP Servers:** These provide the external capabilities—such as access to GitHub repositories, databases, browser automation, or messaging services—that AI can utilize through MCP.
* **Transport and Messaging:** MCP uses [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) over STDIO or HTTP+SSE for communication, ensuring a flexible, secure, and extensible connection.

To begin, try official MCP clients connecting to popular servers like [Slack MCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/slack) or [GitHub MCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github) to see AI tooling in action.

See the [official MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for detailed specs, example implementations, and SDKs.

To begin, try official MCP clients connecting to popular servers like Slack MCP or GitHub MCP to see AI tooling in action. For developers, building custom MCP servers involves implementing the MCP spec and exposing desired capabilities.

## Popular MCP Clients

MCP clients act as the AI's "control panel," facilitating communication between the AI model and external MCP servers that provide access to tools, data, and functionalities. These clients provide various user interfaces—from desktop apps to code editors—to interact seamlessly with MCP servers.

Popular MCP clients include:

**[Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download):** The official desktop client from Anthropic, providing native MCP support and easy access to multiple MCP servers such as Blender MCP for creating 3D models using natural language. Beginner-friendly with no coding required.

**[Cherry Studio](https://cherry-ai.com/):** An emerging client featuring visual configuration tools that simplify MCP server setup with point-and-click ease. Currently under active development with regular community updates.

**[5ire](https://5ire.app/):** A modern AI assistant and MCP client supporting many mainstream providers. It enables file system access, database interaction, remote data fetching, local knowledge bases, usage analytics, prompt libraries, bookmarks, and fast search. Cross-platform across Windows, macOS, and Linux, suited for both developers and non-developers.

**[Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/):** A versatile code editor enhanced with MCP capabilities for writing code, sending Slack messages, generating images, and more. Highly recommended for programmers and integrates well with [GitHub MCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github).

## MCP Servers Overview

MCP servers are the "backend engines" that expose real-world tools, data systems, and APIs to AI clients through the standardized MCP protocol. They enable secure, contextual, and extensible access to functions like messaging platforms, databases, cloud services, code repositories, and browser automation.

Major MCP server categories include:

* Browser automation and web interaction for AI-driven website navigation and form filling.
* Development and code execution servers providing access to interpreters, sandboxes, and IDE integrations.
* Command line and shell servers enabling AI-controlled terminal commands.
* Version control servers managing GitHub, GitLab, and similar services.
* Database integration servers supporting PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, and others.
* Cloud platform servers interfacing with AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, Cloudflare, and more.
* Search servers connecting AI with web and enterprise search engines.
* Communication and collaboration servers integrating Slack, Gmail, Calendar, Teams, Discord.
* Finance and cryptocurrency servers.
* File system and storage access.
* Data analysis and visualization servers.
* Productivity tools and more.

Understanding the server landscape is critical to designing AI applications that leverage MCP to its fullest potential.
